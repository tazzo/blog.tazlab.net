The compose.yml file defines a service named hugo which uses the hugomods/hugo:exts-non-root Docker image. This image includes the extended version of Hugo and runs as a non-root user, enhancing security and providing essential features for a modern Hugo site.\nThe compose.yml also maps the local project directory to /src inside the container, allowing Hugo to serve content from the local files. Port 1313 is exposed to access the development server.\nservices: hugo: image: hugomods/hugo:exts-non-root container_name: hugo command: server --bind=0.0.0.0 --buildDrafts --buildFuture --watch volumes: - ./:/src ports: - \u0026#34;1313:1313\u0026#34; Blowfish Theme Installation # The Blowfish theme was installed using Git submodules. This method ensures that the theme can be easily updated and maintained alongside the main Hugo project.\nInitialize Git Repository: ```bash git init ```\nAdd Blowfish Theme as Submodule: ```bash git submodule add -b main https://github.com/nunocoracao/blowfish.git themes/blowfish ```\nConfigure Theme: The default hugo.toml file was removed, and the configuration files from the Blowfish theme\u0026rsquo;s config/_default/ directory were copied to the site\u0026rsquo;s config/_default/ directory. The theme = \u0026quot;blowfish\u0026quot; line in config/_default/hugo.toml was uncommented to activate the theme.\nThis setup provides a robust and flexible environment for developing a Hugo website with the Blowfish theme.\n","date":"21 December 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/hugo-installation-details/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Hugo Installation Details","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"21 December 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"21 December 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/","section":"Terraforming the Cloud","summary":"","title":"Terraforming the Cloud","type":"page"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"}]
